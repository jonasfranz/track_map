    // Milestone search
    //
    // The milestone endpoint returns the position of milestones or other items such as signals or level crossings with a mapped position on a line.  The API will return the features within a maximum distance of 10 km (hardcoded). The presence of an `operator=*` tag on the tracks is honoured, it will be used to distinguish reference numbers used by different infrastructure operators and/or in different countries.  Mileage is read from the OSM tags `railway:position=*` and `railway:position:exact=*` with precedence of the exact mileage. The tracks must be tagged with a reference number (OSM tag `ref=*`).  The tracks must not tagged with `service=*` (this condition does not apply to tracks with `usage=industrial/military/test`).  Negative mileage is supported but gaps in mileage or duplicated positions (if railway lines are reroute) are not supported. For example, you cannot query for `16.8+200` or things like that.
